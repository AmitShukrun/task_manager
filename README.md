# Task Management Application

### Overview
This project is a simple web application for task management. It allows users to perform essential CRUD operations on tasks, filter them by various parameters, and manage a to-do list in a structured way.

The application consists of three main components:
1. **Database** - Stores task data persistently.
2. **API** - Provides endpoints for interacting with the task data.
3. **Script Interface** - Simulates a basic user interface for managing tasks.
